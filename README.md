# LargeNumberBruteForce
## Description:
Program is designed to generate max value for 8-,16-,32-,64-,128-, 256-, 512- , 1024-, 2048-, 4096-bits and to brute force randomly generated key.

## Features:
### Generated key
Max generated key is 64 bits (unsigned long long), because i couldn't figure out how to generate 64+bits random key.
But it is still enough :).
### Brute force in different threads
For each 8-,16-,32-,64-,128-, 256-, 512- , 1024-, 2048-, 4096-bits I create thread.
